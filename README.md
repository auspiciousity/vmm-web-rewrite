[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/[your GitHub username]/[your repository])

The easiest way to edit this project is to use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) -- it'll automatically set up the environment, download dependencies, expose ports, and start the app.

## on localhost

Get node & npm, install dependencies (`npm i -D`), and then start a dev server (`npm run dev`). Then, open `http://localhost:1234`, and open the path of the file relative to this directory (./pages/index.html --> http://.../pages/index)

# building
```sh
npm run build
# distribution files will be in ./dist
```
