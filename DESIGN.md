# Design

## Colors
### Primary (Foreground elements): `cyan-500` (darker: `cyan-600`)

### Primary (Background elements): `zinc-800` (lighter: `zinc-700`)
As elements' `z` position increases, or they get closer to the user, the color should become lighter

## Border radius
To have an inviting, yet still professional look, the border radii of elements should follow the following:

- For interactive elements, like `buttons`s or `input`s, they should have a normal amount of rounding
- For background and/or separation elements, like boxes, they should have an increased rounding

Additionally,

- To call focus to buttons, like a CTA or callout, round them more.

#### Radii
- Normal: `rounded`
- Increased: `rounded-md`

## Shadowing
As elements' `z` position increases, or they get closer to the user, there should be a light shadow. On a dark background, or to illustrate the primary action, the primary foreground color can be used.

## Typography
- Headings should be the largest text on the page, but within one font size of the next largest text


# Abstract design
## Don't over-complicate things
Elements like primary actions, titles, description text, and more should be obvious
